\usage{
create_address(account_id, body = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{account_id}{Account Id}
}
\description{
Creates a new address for an account. As all the arguments are optional, itâ€™s
possible just to do a empty POST which will create a new address. This is
handy if you need to create new receive addresses for an account on-demand.
Addresses can be created for all account types. With fiat accounts, funds
will be received with Instant Exchange.
