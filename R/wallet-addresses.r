#' Create address
#'
#' Creates a new address for an account. As all the arguments are optional, itâ€™s

#' handy if you need to create new receive addresses for an account on-demand.
#' Addresses can be created for all account types. With fiat accounts, funds
#' will be received with Instant Exchange.
